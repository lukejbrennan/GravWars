To play this game, run the command 'python gravwars.py -p1' in one terminal and 'python gravwars.py -p2' in a second terminal. The gameplay is a back and forth between two ships firing rockets at each other. The goal is to use the gravity of the randomly placed planets to guide your missile into the opponent's ship. Aim your ship with the mouse and click to fire the missile. Each side takes turns firing. If your missile goes out of bounds or hits a planet, it is the next players turn. The player who destroys the other ship in a fiery explosion is the winner!
